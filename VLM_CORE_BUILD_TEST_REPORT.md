### API Endpoints Status
| Endpoint | Status | Response Time | Functionality |
|----------|--------|---------------|---------------|
| `/health` | ✅ Working | ~0.03s | Service monitoring |
| `/languages` | ✅ Working | ~0.02s | Language support |
| `/ocr` | ✅ Working | ~77s | Text extraction |
| `/extract_info` | ✅ Working | ~80s | Structured data extraction |
| `/docs` | ✅ Working | ~0.1s | API documentation |

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Architecture
```
VLM Core Service
├── FastAPI Application (main.py)
├── OCR Processor (ocr_processor.py)
├── LLM Processor (llm_processor.py) 
├── Text Utils (text_utils.py)
└── Docker Container (Python 3.10 + ML libraries)
```

### Model Configuration
- **Base Model**: DistilGPT2 (open-source, no authentication required)
- **OCR Engine**: Tesseract via Python-tesseract
- **Framework**: PyTorch + Hugging Face Transformers
- **Deployment**: Local model inference (no external API calls)

### Key Optimizations Applied
1. **Model Selection**: Replaced gated Gemma with open DistilGPT2
2. **Token Configuration**: Added pad_token handling for generation
3. **Memory Management**: Implemented torch.no_grad() for inference
4. **Error Handling**: Added fallback to original OCR text when LLM fails
5. **Timeout Management**: Reduced max_new_tokens to improve speed
6. **Prompt Engineering**: Optimized prompts for Vietnamese ID documents

## ⚠️ Current Limitations & Recommendations

### Performance Issues
- **Slow Processing**: 77+ seconds per image is too slow for production
- **Model Choice**: DistilGPT2 not optimized for OCR/document processing
- **Single Threading**: Currently processes one request at a time

### Production Recommendations

#### Immediate Improvements (Priority 1)
1. **Model Upgrade**: Replace DistilGPT2 with document-specific model
   - Consider: `microsoft/DialoGPT-large` or `facebook/bart-base`
   - Or use: Specialized OCR models like `microsoft/trocr-*` series

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   ```dockerfile
   # Add to docker-compose.yml
   deploy:
     resources:
       limits:
         memory: 8G        # Increase from 4G
         cpus: '4'         # Allocate more CPU cores
   ```

3. **Async Processing**: Implement background job queue
   ```python
   # Add to main.py
   from fastapi import BackgroundTasks
   
   @app.post("/ocr_async")
   async def ocr_async(background_tasks: BackgroundTasks, ...):
       background_tasks.add_task(process_ocr_async, ...)
   ```

#### Medium-term Improvements (Priority 2)
1. **Model Caching**: Pre-load models to reduce startup time
2. **Batch Processing**: Support multiple images in single request
3. **Result Caching**: Cache OCR results for identical images
4. **Monitoring**: Add Prometheus metrics and logging

#### Long-term Improvements (Priority 3)
1. **GPU Support**: Add CUDA support for faster inference
2. **Model Fine-tuning**: Train custom model on Vietnamese ID documents
3. **Load Balancing**: Multiple service instances with load balancer
4. **Database Integration**: Store OCR results and processing history

### Alternative Model Suggestions
For better OCR performance, consider:

1. **TrOCR Models** (Microsoft):
   ```python
   model_name = "microsoft/trocr-base-printed"  # For printed text
   model_name = "microsoft/trocr-large-printed" # Better accuracy
   ```

2. **LayoutLM Models** (Microsoft):
   ```python
   model_name = "microsoft/layoutlm-base-uncased"  # Document understanding
   ```

3. **PaddleOCR** (Baidu):
   - Excellent for Asian languages including Vietnamese
   - Much faster than current solution
